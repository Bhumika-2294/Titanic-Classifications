# Titanic-Classifications
Data Science Internship

**@BHARAT INTERN**

 **Purpose** : Creating a Titanic survival prediction model involves writing code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. 
Below is a Python code example using the popular Scikit-Learn library to build a logistic regression model for this task. 

**This code performs the following steps:**

Loads the Titanic dataset.
Preprocesses the data by selecting relevant features, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Scales the features using standardization (optional but can help with model convergence).
Builds a logistic regression model.
Trains the model on the training data.
Makes predictions on the testing data.
Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
